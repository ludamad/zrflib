Breakthrough was the winner of the 2001 8x8 Game Design Competition
sponsored by Abstract Games Magazine and the Strategy Gaming Society.

The rules are simple:

Win by moving a piece to the opposite side.  Pieces move forward or
diagonally forward and capture diagonally forward.

Because the pieces have no choice but to move forward, the game 
develops quickly.  Draws are impossible.

The game is similar to a pawn promotion battle, except that the pieces 
move diagonally forward even when not capturing.  This diagonal motion 
allows you to 'skirt' by an opponent piece by facing it head on, where 
it cannot capture you, and then moving diagonally around it.  As a result, 
a single piece cannot by itself prevent an opponent piece from 'breaking 
through' the ranks.  When pieces are spaced out along diagonals, an 
opponent piece can easily skirt through them.  Look for weak links in 
your opponent's defenses where a single piece to the rear is guarding 
two attack routes.

A more detailed discussion of strategy can be found in the "Strategy" 
section that comes with the game.

Breakthrough comes in 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, and 8x8 versions.  

You should extract the game from the downloaded zip file 
preserving path names.
